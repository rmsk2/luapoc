# Info

This repo contains a program which demonstrates that the [`6502profiler`](https://github.com/rmsk2/6502profiler) Lua bridge 
can be used for somewhat useful software.

Use `make run` to start a simple program which implements the "hangman" word guessing game. You will need the ACME macro assembler
to build and run this software. I have only tested this software on Linux (Ubuntu 22.04).
